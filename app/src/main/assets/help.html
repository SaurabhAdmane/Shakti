<p><b>Helpdesk is Cost Recovery Service:</b></p>

<p>Shakti ecosystem is owned and operated by Shakti Coin holders. When a Shakti wallet holder
    contacts helpdesk for customer support it costs everyone to provide the services. This cost is
    paid by the user, that is how we make everyone accountable.</p>

<p>Shakti’s helpdesk will deliver customer support at the rate of 18 Chai for every 5-minute
    increment. This will be remitted from your wallet every time a support ticket is created.</p>

<p>So, depending on your specific inquiry, you’ll receive anything from a relatively generic Shakti
    customer service response to an individualized response addressing your question in detail.</p>

<p>If your Shakti contact provides an answer to your question, but you have additional questions,
    be sure to respond to that same email thread, instead of contacting Shakti helpdesk service
    again by using the general helpdesk support email address.</p>

<p>As a general rule, asking help from Shakti wallet holders is sensible before contacting helpdesk,
    but remember NOT to share your password or surrender your mobile device to strangers.</p>
