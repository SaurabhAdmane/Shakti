<p>Miners with SXE Network IDs earn fees for validating transactions by lending their computing
    power (mining) to the Shakti Network. For that service, they are compensated with fixed
    transaction processing fees.</p>
<br/>
<p>Transaction processing fees are earned by the initiating miner and the first set of confirming
    miners. Fees are paid in Toshi, a microdenomination of SXE Coin.</p>
<br/>
<p>The first miner who initiates the consensus earn 5% of the transaction fee and the set of first
    miners who confirm the consensus earn the remainder of the fees at the rate of 25 Toshi
    (0.00005 SXE or US 0.025¢) per consensus until the sum of fees earned reaches 90% of the total.</p>
<br/>
<p>The final 10% of total fees is paid to the Shakti Network to enforce Global Compliance and SNMP
    Policy and continue to further propagate the SXE monetary policy and to promote Shakti Coin
    adoption globally.</p>
<br/>
<p>Any payment up to and including two (2) Shakti Coins is considered a micro-transaction. The
    cost of a micro-transaction is fixed and it is set at 500 Toshi (= US 2.5¢).</p>
<br/>
<p>The processing payment cost (Y) is calculated as<br/>
Y = SXE 0.005 when transaction size is SXE ≤ 2; and<br/>
    Y = k*Log2(SXE) when SXE > 2.</p>
<br/>
<p>1 Chai (=US 5¢) is the minimum amount that any node can transact over the Shakti Network.</p>
<br/>
<ul>
    <li>All values are measured in SXE.</li>
    <li>The function is continuous. The coefficient, k, regulates the growth rate.</li>
    <li>Y is the value of processing payment cost.</li>
</ul>
